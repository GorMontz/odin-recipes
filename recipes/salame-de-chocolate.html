        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Definitely on my top 3 of Portuguese desserts. A chocolate 
         roll with cookies, without a need to be baked? And with 
         a tad of alcohol? Sign me in!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Dark chocolate</li>
            <li>Milk chocolate</li>
            <li>100g butter, room temperature</li>
            <li>100g Maria biscuits</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1.5 tablespoon Brandy</li>
            <li>50g roasted almonds, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>Caster sugar</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by cutting the chocolate bars into equal-size pieces, add it to a microwave safe bowl, then, microwave it for a minute on high power. Stir it, and if necessary, microwave it again in 30-second intervals, until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the room temperature butter to the melted chocolate, stir well to combine.</li>
            <li>Use a food processor to crush the biscuits into medium size pieces. Alternatively, you can place the biscuits in a Ziploc bag and use a rolling pin to pound them.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed biscuits, almonds, brandy, vanilla extract, and a pinch of salt to your chocolate mixture, stir well. Let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chocolate mixture to a sheet of parchment paper or cling film. Use the paper to shape it into an approximately 5cm diameter tight log. Pop it in the fridge for another 30 minutes before you roll it again, smoothing it. Place it in the fridge again, let it chill for at least 6 hours.</li>
            <li>Remove it from the fridge 15 minutes before serving. Roll it in caster sugar to get that salami look. If the salami is too hard to slice, you can steam your knife with the help of a small pot with boiling water before cutting it.</li>
        </ol>
