        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>It is said Portuguese people can cook codfish in a 1001 ways.
           This is definitely one of my favourites! It is an oven-baked 
           dish consisting of layers of codfish, onion, diced fried potato 
           and cream. It is one of the most famous styles!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500g codfish (Bacalhau)</li>
            <li>6 potatoes</li>
            <li>2 onions</li>
            <li>3 garlic teeth</li>
            <li>200ml cream</li>
            <li>200ml milk</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>If the cod is still not cooked, bake it until it is ready. Remove the bones and peel the skin.</li>
            <li>Cut the potatoes in small cubes and fry them. Do not worry if they are not fully fried, as they will go to the oven for the final touches!</li>
            <li>Cut the onions in thin slices, crush the garlic teeth and involve them with a bit of olive oil. Once the onion looks caramelized, add the codfish. Add salt and pepper "al gusto".</li>
            <li>Put the milk, the cream and a tablespoon of butter in a pan and heat it, until the mix thickens a bit. Remove it from the stove.</li>
            <li>Put the fried potatoes in a tray, together with the codfish. Mix them and involve well with the cream from step 4. Then put it on a tray or baking dish to bring to a preheated oven at 200ÂªC. Leave it for few minutes, until the top gets some color.</li>
        </ol>
